Building a Signup system

Step 1: Creating Registration Form in HTML
I will create a PHP file named register.php . All the input fields are required by adding the "required" attribute which is the default HTML attribute.

Step 2: Creating the MySQL Database Table
You will need to create a new database with any suitable name

Step 3: Creating Database Configuration File
I will create a new PHP file named config.php to connect with the MySQL database.

other steps like "Step 4: Creating a Session File" to check if a user is already logged in, if yes then we will redirect the user to welcome.php file.
I don't know if I can do it. but I'll try!
